  <h4>
    This program shows a n√óm (user inputs) grid of numbers 1 to n.m (shuffled) to user and asks for confirmation to hide it. <br>
    Then it waits 5 secs and shows the new table containing n.m "O"s with a random place that shows "X" instead of "O". <br>
    Finally it asks for the number behind "X". If you say it right, you win! otherwise you lose. Anyway, it shows the first table containing all original numbers.
